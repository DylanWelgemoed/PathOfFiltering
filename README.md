# User
<p>
  This is not for replacing NeverSink but rather a simplified alternative when people are starting out.
  This is meant for those who just want to get into filtering out items and don't want to get into complicated filtering.

  If there is a feature request you are wanting to make please log these as issues to this git repository. (If you can provide additional context of how this could be done it will make your feature request more probable.)

# Developers
Please note I have Vibe Coded this (around 80%), mainly as an experiment for myself to see how far one could get with vibe coding.
If there is bad code, the vibe coding had bad vibes ;)
