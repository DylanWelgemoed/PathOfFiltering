# Data
This is currently all pulled manually couldn't find an api source to get this data.

# Empty JSONs
There are empty jsons where the item type isn't in the league yet. 
These will be added as we go through the leagues and they add more of these types.

I can get the data for those jsons but feel it pointless and will add bloat if not nessecary yet.
